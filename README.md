The project was for Skilled Up Academy's Intro to Front End Web Development Course, week 4.  We were to add onto week 3's website redesign for a fictional start-up company called Dollar Dollar Club.  In this project, we added an Contact page, an About Page, and a Home page which features email signup and links to the other pages.  We added video and Twitter links to the About and Contact pages, respectively.  We also used responsive design for all three web pages.
